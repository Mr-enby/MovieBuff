    <p><strong>Movie Snob / muːvi snɒb / n. 1.</strong>A person without an opinion and appreciates a movie only because it is done so by a critic or other directors.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Someone who can only criticize a movie by saying that it is overrated or has plot holes.</p>
<h2><strong>Chapter One</strong><hr></h2>
<h3>The First Rule Of A Plot Hole Is: You Do Not Talk About The Plot Hole</h3>
<p>Ask me at any midnight, 'The Dark Knight' will sure to be on the top 5 movies list of mine. One of the rarest in my list that I still can watch any number of times from start to finish, without getting bored. But wait, have you ever heard of the 'plot holes' in this movie? Anyways, there is no way that you missed this one, which is sometimes referred to as the giant plot hole of 'The Dark Knight'.

The Joker pushes Rachel down from the building, after which Batman jumps to save her. Batman saves Rachel alone and throws the rest of the people to the Joker to prey on, and what happened to them is a mystery. At this point, some of the professional critics pointed out that the film is terrible.

But there comes the real problem, I have watched the same movie for over fifty times, and such a flaw never caught my eye. This so-called plot hole was never a hindrance while I enjoyed the movie. I happened to think about it only when I read about it. That means, when they criticized the movie by pointing out this particular plot hole, they did not even consider the audience who enjoyed the film as much as I did. Well, that's some top-notch criticism.

Not just the case of 'Dark Knight' take Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite'

"Why didn't the police finally search the house and find him?"

"How did someone else buy that house when so much happened there?"

"Wouldn't the new landlords catch him trying to communicate by turning the lights on and off?"

You could ask even more! But if you try to fix all these plot holes and reshoot the movie, you will get the mini versions of The Dark Knight and Parasite!

If you want to tell a story, you can't always ignore plot holes. If storytelling is not affected by a plot hole and it is never a hindrance to the enjoyment, what is the point of discussing it in the first place? In a world where everything moves, friction is a plot hole. But one can only imagine what would have happened without it! As simple as that.

<h2>Chapter Two
</h2><hr>
<h3>Once Upon A Time In An Overrated Territory</h3>
<p>'Interstellar'... I know a lot of people have an aversion to this name but wait; this is just another example. 'Arrival' is one such movie that is praised and compared with Interstellar and a personal favorite of many, including myself. But I never felt the urge to watch 'Arrival' more than twice. Interstellar, on the other hand, I still watch a bunch of scenes repeatedly.

But that is just my perspective, and I believe many other people are out there who share the same opinion as me. It is not anyone's fault that if they are more in number. So if you think 'Arrival' is underrated and 'Interstellar' is overrated, you can only do one thing, eliminate the bigger group by half. SNAP! balance everything.

The moral of the story? Well, if you 'feel' a movie is overrated, it is no one's fault. It's just a 'feeling,' and you got to think twice when you use that word. Because when you say a movie is Overrated or Overpraised, and if you are indirectly stating that the film gets more praise than it deserves, there comes the next problem.

Is there a fixed amount of praise that a particular movie should get? Do you have an instrument for measuring the deserved recognition for a film? Are there such standards? Even if there are such measurable standards, are they absolute and objective? Or are they just based upon your opinions alone?

</p>
<ol>
  <li>f the standards are objective, it also applies to the movies you think are great. Judging by any objective criteria, many of the films we call great have to be brought down.
</li>
<li>Now, if you judge excessive praise with just your opinions to back it up, that is just your opinion! We cannot decide what others should praise.
</li>

<h2>Chapter Three

<h3>The Inglourious Snob
</h3>
<p>
'Citizen kane' is a groundbreaking movie, and so is 'Jurassic Park'. But have you ever said that Citizen Kane is way better than Jurassic Park? Well, if our inner snob jumps out, this is not the case, we'll say much more pointless stuff. There is no better way to insult these two movies than to compare them.

If we could consider movies as objects, it's possible to quantitatively measure and weigh to decide which is the best film. But one must know the greatness of a film is never dependent on the objective elements.

'2001: A Space Odyssey' is a film that transcends the limitations of that period's technology. It's also a movie that predicted the future with clear cut accuracy. But these are all subjective elements and depend on the period in which the movie was made.

It's never the fact that it follows certain scriptwriting rules, how the camera angles were used, and the usage of dialogue in the right amount that makes the film one of the greatest. Instead, it's respect for the director's vision and the countless opinions of many. That does not mean that the film should not be criticized, i.e., no classic movie is Bulletproof. If someone thinks so, they are eligible for a Movie Snob recognition.

Remember, acid hippies and stoners who went to see the last 10 minutes of 'Space Odyssey' to see the Star-Gate Sequence in the theatre just to get tripped have their share of reasons why the movie is one of the greatest.

So, if you encounter someone praising any movie, it is not your frustration that you should be expressing. If you want to state the movie you support is far better than the other, you should also back up your statement. If the points you make are just your opinions, they are not relevant.

But if you have a strong reason to believe that your opinion will be convincing to someone, try to prove that your favorite movie is the better one. If that doesn't work, give up. Because trying to evaluate a film objectively is almost impossible.
</p><br>
<p><strong>If movies could be judged purely based on objective standards, these things would have happened:
</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Avatar 2 is better directed by Clint Eastwood, as Clint Eastwood won more Oscars compared to James Cameron.</li>
  <li>A jury is not necessary to decide awards. Instead, teach someone about all points that a good movie should have or create computer softwares to identify these points.</li>
  <li>Movies might have been made for robots or bananas rather than humans.</li>
  <p>Criticism should never be frustrations. The more you try to become objective about movies, the more you have to give up your own opinions. You are going to suck up the enjoyment factor. You will no longer be able to distinguish between art and objects. A fully formed Movie Snob will hatch out of your shell.</p>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Which would be worse: to live as a snob, or to die as a true cinema fan?
